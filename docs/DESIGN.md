`temples` is an automatic file generator based on predefined templates. I want to avoid the tedious boilerplate coding that we see everyday in our work â€” React components as an example.

## MVP Features

- [ ] Generate file(s) based on HBS templates.
- [ ] Run `temples` as a CLI "wizard"
- [ ] Run `temples` as a CLI command
- [ ] Provide basic HBS filters (e.g. kebab, title, snake cases)
- [ ] Point to user defined files for config and templates

## Goals

- [ ] Add code to existing files
- [ ] Allow custom HBS instance to add filters, etc.
